# AI and ML Server Setup

This is the code that accompanies the [AI Server from Scratch in AWS video]().

This project walks through setting up an AWS EC2 instance optimized for generative AI and machine learning tasks, using NVIDIA and Docker on Ubuntu.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of:
  - AWS (EC2)
  - Virtual Machines
  - Linux / Command Line / SSH
- Familiarity with Docker and containerization concepts

### Goals

1. Configure a compute-optimized VM from scratch (starting with a blank Ubuntu image)
2. Ensure portability to avoid vendor lock-in and reduce dependence on platform-specific tools
3. Create a flexible environment suitable for various AI and ML frameworks
